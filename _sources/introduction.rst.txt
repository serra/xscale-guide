About this guide
================

XSCALE Alliance is a learning ecosystem of independent coaches and consultancies 
de-scaling agile organizations through practices derived from

 * Hiawatha's Great Law of Peace
 * Rikyu's Mu Hin Shu
 * Goldratt's Throughput Accounting
 * Holmgren's Permaculture
 * Stack's Open Book Management
 * and Beck's Extreme Programming

Like Linux, we use open source licensing 
to collaborate on coaching and training material 
for pattern languages – not frameworks – 
for Business Agility, Product Management and DevOps.

We're not like the big training frameworks. 
We're coaches, not trainers, 
using XSCALE ourselves to collaborate on engagements, collateral and tools.

This guide is one of the results of such a collaboration.
In it, we collected patterns and practices that were most useful to us.

We hope this guide will help you to
build self-directing portfolios 
of self-managing streams 
of self-organizing teams of your existing staff.

We hope this guide will help you to run a self-propagating transformation. 
Build a slender but uncompromised capability, then grow it. 

So that your organization can be like pods of dolphins, not dancing elephants.

Sincerely,

Your friends from the XSCALE Alliance
