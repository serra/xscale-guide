XSCALE Roles
============

`View article on our wiki <https://xscale.wiki/#XSCALE%20Roles>`__

There are two kinds of `Servant
Leader <https://xscale.wiki/#Leadership%20as%20a%20Service>`__ role in
an `XSCALE Organization <https://xscale.wiki/#XSCALE%20Organization>`__:
Coach and Leader. In general one coach
`pairs <https://xscale.wiki/#Pair-Working>`__ with one leader per the
`Leadership as a
Service <https://xscale.wiki/#Leadership%20as%20a%20Service>`__ practice
pattern. Each carries distinct responsibilities to reinforce their
squads’ `autonomy <https://xscale.wiki/#Autonomous%20Squad>`__.

**Coach Responsibilities**

-  Determining the `Last Responsible
   Moment <https://xscale.wiki/#Last%20Responsible%20Moment>`__ for the
   team to make a decision
-  Structuring and scheduling ceremonies
-  Quality-assuring the outcome of each ceremony

**Leader Responsibilities**

-  Making the decision if there’s no unanimity in the `Last Responsible
   Moment <https://xscale.wiki/#Last%20Responsible%20Moment>`__
-  Prioritising the input to each ceremony
-  Representing outcomes of ceremonies to other teams

Leader and Coach are functional roles, not job titles, so it is possible
for someone to play more than one such role at the same time. It is also
commonplace that doing so is sub-optimal as it overloads an individual
while imbalancing power relationships in their team.

For the specific responsibilities of leaders and coaches per squad see
`XSCALE Coaches <https://xscale.wiki/#XSCALE%20Coaches>`__ and `XSCALE
Leaders <https://xscale.wiki/#XSCALE%20Leaders>`__.
