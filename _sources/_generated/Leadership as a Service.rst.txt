Leadership as a Service
=======================

`View article on our wiki <https://xscale.wiki/#Leadership%20as%20a%20Service>`__

   Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great
   men are almost always bad men. – `Lord
   Acton <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984314000800>`__

The most enlightened civilisations in history regulated the ambitions of
their leaders through systems of checks and balances. Perhaps the most
successful example is the Iroquois `Fire Keepers’
Consensus <https://xscale.wiki/#Fire%20Keepers'%20Consensus>`__.

   Accurate communication only happens between equals – `Robert Anton
   Wilson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine%27s_laws#Celine.27s_Second_Law>`__

When a leader doesn’t serve their team, but instead requires service,
team members don’t dare communicate accurately with the leader or, for
fear of being quoted, with each other. As scaling the responsibilities
of leadership eventually overwhelms any individual, leaders are obliged
to delegate accountability to subordinates via `Command and
Control <https://xscale.wiki/#Command%20and%20Control>`__, which
restricts teams from responding autonomously to change and so generates
`Cultural Debt <https://xscale.wiki/#Cultural%20Debt>`__.

**Therefore,**

Supply leadership only when a team requires it to achieve a decision in
a timely manner. To assure this we split decision-making
responsibilities between two roles. Here we’ll call them Coach and
Leader.

1. If the rest of the team are unanimous about a decision, the Leader
   role doesn’t get to decide. Servant leaders lead through influence,
   not authority.
2. Only when the Coach judges the team can’t reach a decision before the
   `Last Responsible
   Moment <https://xscale.wiki/#Last%20Responsible%20Moment>`__ - then
   the Leader decides. The squad abides by any such decision until and
   unless its other members unanimously overrule it.
3. A Leader can only lead their own squad. For the sake of
   `autonomy <https://xscale.wiki/#Autonomous%20Squad>`__, no Leader is
   permitted to make decisions for any other team. teams, which are
   fully capable of `representing
   themselves <https://xscale.wiki/#Team%20Representation>`__.

Where a team is obliged to report into a Manager, the decision only
constitutes advice from the team. Where teams composit in a
`Holarchy <https://xscale.wiki/#Holarchy>`__, there need be no
intermediary managers.

Where an agreement must span more than one team, and disagreement or
dependency cycles make this inefficient, teams align by `Team
Representation <https://xscale.wiki/#Team%20Representation>`__. To keep
alignment relevant to current circumstances, they regularly `Brighten
The Chain <https://xscale.wiki/#Brighten%20The%20Chain>`__. Real servant
leadership is more proactive than simple checks and balances. Its
essence is generating
`consensus <https://xscale.wiki/#Consensus%20Decision-Making>`__.

In order to assure that Leaders are passionately committed to the team’s
success, they should be treated as `Directly Responsible
Individual <https://xscale.wiki/#Directly%20Responsible%20Individual>`__\ s.
This places a leader under tension; on the one hand they represent a
specific responsibility; on the other, they’re forced to lead through
influence rather than authority. To succeed in the role requires vision,
passion and empathy - all the attributes of a `Servant
Leader <https://xscale.wiki/#Servant%20Leader>`__.
