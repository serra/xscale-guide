Throughput Diagram
==================

-  In `Lean Manufacturing <Lean%20Manufacturing>`__, the progress of a
   `Kanban <Kanban>`__ is tracked over time using a {{Cumulative Flow
   Diagram}} (CFD). CFDs are superior to traditional Agile
   burndown/burnup charts because they make it easier to see causes of
   `Waste <Waste>`__, `Stress <Stress>`__ and
   `Instability <Instability>`__.
-  To represent `Throughput <Throughput>`__ the diagram must account for
   the time taken up in analysing the Features in an Epic and the
   Stories in a Feature, not just the delivery and integration workflow
   per story, and continuously represent the components of Return as
   well.
-  If a `Value Stream <Value%20Stream>`__ is trying to hit a calendar
   date It’s important to be able to see by simple visual inspection of
   diagrams when the feature point budget for a feature has been
   exceeded by `Story Point <Story%20Point>`__ estimates, and that
   consequently a release must be
   `refactored <Release%20Refactoring>`__.

**Therefore,**

`Feature Point <Feature%20Point>`__\ s provide a simple basis for this
kind of accounting. The cost of an Epic over the life of a release is
the sum of its Feature Points. And as each Feature is delivered by just
one Squad at a time, the Feature Point cost of a story is simply its
`Story Point <Story%20Point>`__\ s divided by Squad
`Velocity <Velocity>`__.

A CFD that represents all these metrics is called a **Throughput
Diagram**. The topmost “return” line can represent revenue or an Epic’s
`Critical Number <Critical%20Number>`__. As with CFDs, Throughput
Diagrams can be added together to represent the flows of whole
`Portfolio <Portfolio>`__\ s.
